# Limehome challenge - Frontend Engineer


### how to run the application
- git clone https://github.com/ravindrap52/responsive-form.git
- cd to responsive-form
- npm install
- npm run start
- the application runs on localhost:4200

### few things i did
- to avoid layout shifting I used min-height, because when we show the error message the layout will shift because we are displaying a new html element.
- on imge tag i used priority because of large content painting.
- to avoid unnecessary dom looping i used different function or accordian.

### few things we can still impove
- making a resuable component and use it.
- we can improve a some responsiveness as well.
